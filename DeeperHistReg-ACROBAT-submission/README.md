# DeeperHistReg - ACROBAT submission

The repository contains the source code used by AGHSSO team during the ACROBAT challenge.

This is a minimal working example that produces the submission file for the competition and allows one to reproduce the results.

The full framework containing the full source code, deep networks, training scripts, pretrained models, additional high-resolution nonrigid step, and convenient utility functions to deal with WSIs at full resolution - will be available soon at:  [DeeperHistReg](https://github.com/MWod/DeeperHistReg)
